# App-for-Phosphate-quality-flotation-Prediction
ReactApp

This App describes the approaches and methods used to predict the quality of phosphates's flotation 


In the beginning, I started our approach by defining the context of our project with
a presentation of the action plan to be implemented while respecting the DMAIC approach
throughout this work. 

Then, I  did a complete study of the process to familiarize ourselves
with its equipment and to understand the interactions between its various parts. This helps
to consolidate the set of initial data propose and therefore introduce and build predictive
models that allow a quality estimate (BPL, MGO, CO2) of the phosphates discharged from
the process,

Subsequently I proposed numerical methods for solving the mathematical optimization problem that helps to find the optimal parameters for achieving a desired quality
set beforehand.

Finally, all the results obtained are implemented on a web application with
learning features and procedures that facilitate integration with the enterprise API.
